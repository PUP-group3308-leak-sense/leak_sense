## How to Use and Run `simulation.py`

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a virtual environment set up.
2. Obtain the `credentials.json` file from Firebase.

### Steps
1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    source leak_sense_python/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows, use:
    ```sh
    leak_sense_python\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Place `credentials.json`**
    Ensure the `credentials.json` file is in the project directory:
    ```sh
    /c:/Users/Reynold/pup/simulation/credentials.json
    ```

3. **Run the Simulation**
    Execute the `simulation.py` script:
    ```sh
    python simulation.py
    ```

### Notes
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated whenever you run the script.
- If you encounter any issues, check the `credentials.json` file and ensure it is correctly configured.
